# SPSR-Net

## Overview

SPSR-Net is an improved research branch built on [DiFiNet: Boundary-Aware Semantic Differentiation and Filtration Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zAig3Mmy1v), accepted by ACL 2024.

## Requirements

```
GPU=NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core
beautifulsoup4==4.9.3
FastNLP==1.0.1
fitlog==0.9.15
nltk==3.8.1
numpy==1.24.4
pandas==1.1.3
sparse==0.14.0
torch==1.13.1+cu117
torch_scatter==2.0.9
tqdm==4.65.0
transformers==4.20.1
```

## Deployment Without Direct HuggingFace Access

For network-restricted environments (cannot access HuggingFace directly), use local backbone download + local path training.

1. Create environment and install deps:
   ```bash
   conda create -n difinet python=3.10 -y
   conda activate difinet
   pip install --no-cache-dir torch==2.3.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   pip install --no-cache-dir torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.3.0+cu121.html
   pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements
   ```

2. Download GENIA backbone model to `pretrained_models/`:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_backbones.py \
     --source wisemodel \
     --groups genia \
     --wisemodel-endpoint https://hf-mirror.com
   ```

   If HF-compatible mirror is unavailable, you can fallback to ModelScope:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_backbones.py --source modelscope --groups genia
   ```

3. Put GENIA preprocessed files in:
   ```text
   preprocess/outputs/genia/
   ```

4. Run training:
   ```bash
   bash train_arg_genia.sh
   ```

`train.py` will automatically prioritize local models under `pretrained_models/` for each dataset.

## Preprocess your datasets
Put ACE datasets in the `preprocess/data` directory, following a similar structure as demonstrated in [CNN_Nested_NER](https://github.com/yhcc/CNN_Nested_NER) 

For GENIA dataset, we use the version from [W2NER](https://github.com/ljynlp/W2NER)

## Train

   ```
   bash train_arg_{dataset}.sh
   ```
The item {dataset} can be replaced with "04", "05" or "genia". The experiment results can be found in the directory `logs` after initiating the training process.
